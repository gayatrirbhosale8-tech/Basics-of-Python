## 🎯 Aim
To study and implement **conditional statements in Python** using different real-life programming problems such as number checking, grading system, leap year validation, date validation, and salary calculation.

---

## 📖 Theory
Conditional statements are used to **control the flow of execution** of a program based on conditions.  
Python provides the following conditional constructs:

- `if`  
- `if–else`  
- `if–elif–else`  

These statements evaluate expressions that return **True or False** and execute code blocks accordingly ✅❌.

## 🛠️ Programs Performed

---

### 🔹 1. Check Whether a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero
📥 Takes a number as input and checks its nature.

**Concept Used:** `if–elif–else`

---

### 🔹 2. Check Whether a Number is Odd or Even
📥 Accepts a number and checks divisibility by 2.

**Concept Used:** `if–else` and modulus operator `%`

---

### 🔹 3. Find the Largest of Two Numbers
📥 Compares two numbers and prints the larger one.

**Concept Used:** Relational operators and `if–elif`

---

### 🔹 4. Find the Largest of Three Numbers
📥 Accepts three numbers and determines the maximum.

**Concept Used:** Logical operators (`and`) with `if–elif–else`

---

### 🔹 5. Grade Calculation Using Average Marks
📥 Takes marks of **5 subjects** and calculates:
- Average marks
- Grade based on conditions

🎓 **Grades Used:**  
- O, A+, A, B+, B, Study Harder

**Concept Used:** Nested `if–elif–else`

---

### 🔹 6. Check Whether a Year is a Leap Year
📥 Accepts a year and checks leap year conditions.

📅 **Leap Year Rules:**
- Divisible by 4 and not by 100  
- OR divisible by 400  

---

### 🔹 7. Validate a Date and Print Incremented Date
📥 Accepts date in `dd/mm/yyyy` format and:
- Validates the date
- Prints the incremented date if valid

📆 Handles:
- Month limits
- Leap year February
- Year change on 31st December

---

### 🔹 8. Salary Calculation with Allowances
📥 Calculates **Gross Salary** based on Basic Salary.

💰 **Conditions:**
- Basic ≤ 10000 → HRA 20%, DA 80%
- Basic ≤ 20000 → HRA 25%, DA 90%
- Above 20000 → HRA 30%, DA 95%

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Relational Operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`)
- Logical Operators (`and`, `or`)
- User Input (`input()`)
- Type Conversion (`int()`)

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This experiment helped in understanding how **conditional statements** are used to make decisions in Python programs 🧩.  
Such logic is essential for **real-world applications** like grading systems, salary calculations, and validation programs 🚀.

---

## ✨ Result
All conditional statement programs were **successfully executed**, and the objective of the experiment was achieved 🎉🐍
