## 👩‍🎓 Student Details
- **Name:** Gayatri Bhosale  
- **PRN:** 25070123033  
- **Branch:** ENTC – A2  

---

## 🎯 Aim
To study and implement **loops in Python**, specifically the **while loop**, by solving different programming problems.

---

## 📘 Theory
A loop in Python is used to execute a block of statements 🔄 repeatedly as long as a given condition is true.

### 🔁 While Loop
The `while` loop is used when the **number of iterations is not known in advance**.

**Syntax:**
```python
while condition:
