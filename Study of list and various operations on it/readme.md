# Experiment 3: Study of List and Various Operations

## Student Details
- **Name:** Gayatri Bhosale  
- **PRN:** 25070123033  
- **Batch:** ENTC A2  

---

## Aim
To study the definition, creation, and manipulation of Lists in Python, and to implement various built-in list methods and operations to solve practical problem statements.

---

## Theory
A **List** in Python is a built-in data structure used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of the four built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data.

### Key Characteristics of Lists
- **Ordered:** Items have a defined order that does not change.
- **Mutable:** Items can be changed, added, or removed after creation.
- **Allows Duplicates:** Lists can contain elements with the same value.
- **Heterogeneous:** A list can store elements of different data types such as integers, strings, and booleans.

---

## Objectives & Scope
This experiment covers the following list operations:
- **Creation:** Defining lists with various data types.
- **Indexing & Slicing:** Accessing elements using positive and negative indices.
- **Modification:** Changing item values, appending, inserting, and extending lists.
- **Analysis:** Using built-in functions like `sort()`, `min()`, `max()`, `len()`, and `sum()`.

---

## Code Implementation & Problem Statements
The experiment addresses the following five problem statements:

### 1. General List Operations
Demonstration of basic list functionalities:
- Checking length using `len()`
- Accessing items using indexing
- Reverse indexing
- List repetition
- Membership testing using the `in` operator

---

### 2. Slicing Analysis
Extracting specific subsets of data from a list:
- Elements from index 1 to 3
- First three elements
- Elements from index 2 onwards

---

### 3. Student Marks Analysis
**Input:** A list of student marks  
**Operations:**
- Find the highest mark
- Find the lowest mark
- Calculate the average mark
- Sort marks in ascending order

---

### 4. Grocery List Management
**Input:** A list of grocery items  
**Operations:**
- Extend the list with new items
- Remove specific items (e.g., `"Masala"`)
- Display the final updated list

---

### 5. Contact List & Temperature Analysis
**Contact List Operations:**
- Append new contacts
- Remove specific contacts
- Sort contacts alphabetically

**Temperature Analysis:**
- Analyze a 10-day temperature dataset
- Display the first 5 days and last 5 days
- Find highest and lowest temperatures
- Calculate average temperature

---

## Conclusion
In this experiment, Python Lists were successfully studied. We learned how to create lists, access elements using indexing and slicing, and modify lists using methods such as `append()`, `insert()`, and `remove()`. These concepts were applied to real-world data scenarios including student marks analysis, grocery list management, and temperature data evaluation.
